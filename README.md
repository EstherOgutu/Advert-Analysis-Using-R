# Advert-Analysis-Using-R
An online cryptography course has been created and needs to be advertised on the blog of the entrepreneur who created it. The target audience for the advert originate from various countries. In the past, the entrepreneur has ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She, therefore wish to employ my services as a Data Science Consultant to assist her in identifying the individuals are most likely to click on her ads.
# Specifying the Data Analytic Question
This is an analysis to identifying the individuals are most likely to click on her ads.
# Defining the Metric of Success
The metric of success for this project is to identifying the individuals are most likely to click on her ads using Univariate and Bivariate Analysis.
# Analysis
I have done an analysis of the project and this is the [link](https://rpubs.com/Esther_O/908262) to my document on RPubs. 
# Recording the Experimental Data
For this analysis, I will perform the following actions:

1. Loading the Data.

2. Reading the Data.

3. Cleaning the Dataset.

4. Performing EDA:

  - Univariate Analysis.

  - Bivariate Analysis.

5. Conclusion.

6. Recommendation.
